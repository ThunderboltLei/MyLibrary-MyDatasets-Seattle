On the Saturday after Thanksgiving, residents will plant native plants in Vivian McLean Park and then have a gathering in the Duwamish Co-housing Common House.  Dinner will be provided.  Local grocery stores will be asked to donate bread, salad makings, pies, and non-alcoholic beverages, and several neighbors will make pots of soup.  Participants may bring a dish to share from their cultural background.  Neighborhood musicians will perform followed by a talent show/cultural sharing (open to anyone in the neighborhood, with sign-ups in advance). There will be displays of neighbors’ arts and crafts.  A bulletin board will be available on which people can post information about Puget-Ridge-based businesses (babysitting, home repair, music instruction, gardening, computer consulting, etc).  The PRNC will ask everyone to sign in with their contact information and, if they wish, any interests or needs they have that they’d like to share with other neighbors, i.e., exercising or playing music together, car-pooling to the store. There will be door prizes and other prizes solicited from nearby establishments (Bubbles Cafe on Delridge Way and the bookstore and nursery at South Seattle Community College) — to help draw attention to other local resources.



PRNC will publicize the event by distributing fliers door-to-door to many of the neighborhood households.
