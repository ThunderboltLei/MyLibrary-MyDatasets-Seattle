Too many competing priorities in Seattle; public education is not a high priority; the city has fewer families than many cities Lack of a network of interest groups for students throughout the city; lack of student governance structures/practice; lack of “civics” experience (civil rights, advocacy) Equitable opportunities in schools with a focus on South Seattle; need more community involvement in schools; community identity; district problem: school buildings are not equal; city problem: areas of city are not equal A geographical divide separates schools in the 98118 area code with virtually every other region in Seattle for both Special Education and General Education families.  Only in the Southeast quadrant of the district are more students seeking to depart local schools rather than choosing to stay -- by a huge margin.  The Dunlop, Aki and Rainier Beach pathway really is not equal to the Laurelhurst, Eckstein and Roosevelt pathway. Similarly, private or public nonschool services open to, or specifically for, disabled kids north of the ship canal are vastly superior to points south.  These include summer camps, daycare, respite services, ""sibshops"", Outdoors for All sites, gymnastics, swim lessons, soccer, physicians and therapists, etc.

Achievement Gap for persons with disabilities; factoring in disabilities has to become part of the formula for determining achievement; can have different “bars” but with rigor, Some students are exited from special education services and later have community needs such as job preparation and career planning. Civil rights violations are moving beyond the school walls , into all stakeholder groups and public agencies, as there is a pervasive notion and collective thinking that children with disabilities cannot achieve, on any level!

Many people are unable/don’t know how to navigate bureaucracy to improve schools; inability to speak “the language” (literally and figuratively); need for outreach positions (being cut in district) More communication by district with families; outreach to diverse communities Schools not being used as neighborhood/community centers or gathering centers Public safety in the southeast quadrant, in particular, is lacking; it would be one of the cornerstones of a successful neighborhood and school linkage.  Need for a fundamental change in the school system’s ability to listen to input from the community, reflect their understanding of community concerns back to community members, and flexibly incorporate community concerns into their decision-making process.
